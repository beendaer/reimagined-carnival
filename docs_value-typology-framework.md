# Comprehensive Value Typology Framework

**Last Updated**: 2026-02-05  
**Status**: Draft for Integration

## 1. Primary Theoretical Structure

### 1.1 Three-Level Distinction
- **Descriptive Theories**: What people *actually* value (empirical observation)
- **Normative Theories**: What *ought* to be valued (ethical judgment)
- **Meta-Normative Theories**: The nature and epistemology of value itself

### 1.2 Normative Subdivisions
- **Deontological**: Inherent rightness (duty-based ethics)
- **Teleological**: Outcome-focused (utilitarian sum-ranking)
- **Axiological**: Inherent goodness (value-based)

## 2. Core Value Distinctions

### 2.1 Intrinsic vs. Instrumental Value
| Type | Definition | Example |
|------|------------|---------|
| **Intrinsic** | Good for its own sake; an end in itself | Freedom, beauty, happiness |
| **Instrumental** | Good as a means to an end | Money, tools, credentials |

### 2.2 Held vs. Assigned Values
| Type | Domain | Function |
|------|--------|----------|
| **Held Values** | Internal standards, enduring beliefs | Inner compass, guiding principles |
| **Assigned Values** | Quantifiable external worth | Market price, utility score |

### 2.3 Terminal vs. Instrumental Values (Rokeach)
- **Terminal Values**: Prized end-states (freedom, security, wisdom)
- **Instrumental Values**: Preferred modes of conduct (honesty, ambition, courage)

## 3. Formal Axiology (Mathematical Synthesis)

### Three-Tier Hierarchy
1. **Systemic Value**: Fulfillment of synthetic mental constructs (logical systems, theories)
2. **Extrinsic Value**: Degree of fulfillment of analytic concepts (functional utility)
3. **Intrinsic Value**: Unique singular objects with infinite, non-denumerable properties (persons, art)

**Purpose**: Prevent "chaotic representation" by establishing precise measurement criteria.

## 4. Political Economy Integration

### Abstract vs. Concrete Labour
- **Concrete Labour**: Physiological activity (making shoes, writing code)
- **Abstract Labour**: Historically-specific social relation (value creation under capitalism)

**Function**: Abstract labour serves as the "transmission belt" unifying society's productive system.

## 5. Cross-Cultural Integration: Indian Puruṣārthas

| Puruṣārtha | Translation | Scope |
|------------|-------------|-------|
| **Dharma** | Righteous duty | Moral/ethical framework |
| **Artha** | Wealth/prosperity | Material well-being |
| **Kama** | Desire/pleasure | Aesthetic/emotional fulfillment |
| **Moksha** | Liberation | Spiritual transcendence |

**Integration Principle**: Unified evaluation basis preventing disciplinary cross-pollination while honoring distinct value domains.

## 6. Implementation Framework

### Ascent from Abstract to Concrete
1. Begin with isolated categorizations (individual value types)
2. Synthesize into concrete universal (many determinations unified)
3. Avoid conceptual conflation across boundaries

### Multidisciplinary Clarification Requirements
- Philosophy (normative/meta-normative analysis)
- Psychology (held values, terminal/instrumental mapping)
- Economics (labour theory, exchange value)
- Anthropology (cultural value systems)
- Mathematics (formal axiology quantification)

**Next Steps**:
1. Map to existing ValueForge decision framework
2. Integrate with deception detection logic (value-alignment scoring)
3. Create API endpoints for value classification
4. Build UI for value typology selection
